            "Document 3: خطا تشلسي خطوة كبيرة نحو ضمان المشاركة الموسم المقبل في مسابقة دوري أبطال أوروبا التي فقد لقبها هذا الموسم، عندما تعادل مع جاره اللندني توتنهام 2-2 في قمة مثيرة على ملعب ستامفورد بريدج في لندن في مباراة مؤجلة من المرحلة الثالثة والثلاثين من الدوري الإنجليزي لكرة القدم .أهدر تشلسي فوزاً في المتناول كان سيسمح له بالتركيز جيداً على نهائي مسابقة الدوري الأوروبي يوروبا ليغ أمام بنفيكا البرتغالي في 15 مايو/أيار الحالي، كونه تقدم مرتين وحتى الدقيقة 80 قبل أن يخطف توتنهام التعادل الذي أبقى آماله في منافسة جاريه اللندنيين تشلسي وأرسنال على البطاقتين الأخيرتين للمسابقة القارية العريقة، وإن كان مصيره ليس بيده .وعزز تشلسي موقعه في المركز الثالث برصيد 69 نقطة قبل مرحلتين من نهاية الموسم بفارق نقطتين أمام أرسنال الرابع و3 نقاط أمام توتنهام الخامس الذي يخوله مركزه الحالي المشاركة في مسابقة الدوري الأوروبي .ويلعب تشلسي مباراتيه الأخيرتين مع أستون فيلا وايفرتون، وأرسنال مع ويغان ونيوكاسل، وتوتنهام مع ستوك سيتي وسندرلاند، علماً بأن تشلسي وأرسنال يتفوقان في فارق الأهداف على توتنهام، حيث يملك الأول ،34 والثاني ،31 والثالث 18 .على خط آخر،إذا أراد ويغان تحقيق واحدة من كبرى المفاجآت في نهائي كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي لكرة القدم منذ سنوات سيكون عليه تحدي التاريخ، وتجاوز مخاوفه من الهبوط للفوز على مانشستر سيتي يوم غد السبت .وسيبدأ سيتي بطل الكأس 2011 والفائز بالدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز الموسم الماضي، المباراة كمرشح بارز للفوز في استاد ويمبلي لكن ويغان أظهر في مرات عديدة هذا الموسم أنه قادر على تفجير مفاجآت خاصة حين سحق إيفرتون بثلاثية نظيفة في دور الثمانية . لكن ويغان لم يفز سوى مرة وحيدة على منافسه في آخر سبع مباريات بين الفريقين، كما يتفوق سيتي عليه في جميع المراكز . وفي مباريات الفريقين منذ ،2010 لم يسجل ويغان أي هدف مقابل 13 هدفاً سجلها سيتي .والمرة الأخيرة التي نجح فيها ويغان في الفوز على سيتي كانت قبل خمس سنوات تقريبا حين انتصر 2-1 عن طريق أنطونيو فالنسيا وعمرو زكي من ركلة جزاء في الدوري في سبتمبر/أيلول 2008 .وبينما سيخوض ويغان الذي يحتل المركز 18 في الدوري نهائي كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي للمرة الأولى في تاريخه سيدخل سيتي المباراة النهائية بلا أي مخاوف .وبعدما خسر لقبه في الدوري لمصلحة غريمه مانشستر يونايتد قبل أسبوعين ضمن سيتي بالفعل اللعب في دوري أبطال أوروبا الموسم المقبل بالفوز على وست بروميتش البيون 1-صفر يوم الثلاثاء الماضي . ولا يبدو أن شيئاً يمكن أن يوقف الفريق عن التتويج بلقب الكأس سوى العودة لحالة الاسترخاء التي شابت أداءه الدفاعي، أو حدوث تراجع مفاجئ في المستوى .وسيتأثر ويغان بكثرة الإصابات وبسبب ذلك، إضافة لسوء الدفاع خسر الفريق 3-2 أمام سوانزي سيتي يوم الثلاثاء الماضي، ما جعل كثيرين لا يعتقدون أن الفريق يملك فرصاً حقيقية في النهائي .وسيلعب ويغان من دون لاعب الوسط المؤثر ماينور فيغيروا، بينما سيستمر غياب المدافع إيفان راميس بسبب إصابة في الركبة . ويحوم شك حول مشاركة انطولين الكاراز بعد غيابه عن مباراة سوانزي فيما تعرض روني ستام لكسر في الساق يوم الثلاثاء الماضي .ويقدم ويغان كرة قدم جيدة بوجود شون مالوني القادر على صنع الفرص في خط الوسط .وتألق أرونا كوني مهاجم ساحل العاج مع الفريق في موسمه الأول مع النادي، حيث سجل 13 هدفاً .وأياً كانت نتيجة المباراة يوم غد السبت فإن ويغان قد ضمن اللعب في كأس الأندية الأوروبية في الموسم المقبل .\n",
            "Document 4: يحتضن ملعب «ستامفورد بريدج» في غرب لندن مواجهة نارية الأربعاء بين تشلسي حامل لقب الدوري الإنجليزي والجريح هذا الموسم وباريس سان جرمان المهيمن في فرنسا ضمن إياب الدور ثمن النهائي لمسابقة دوري أبطال أوروبا لكرة القدم.ويدخل سان جرمان الحالم بلقبه الأول في دوري الأبطال المواجهة متمتعاً بأفضلية التقدم ذهابا على ارضه 2-1 بهدف متأخر من مهاجمه الأوروغوياني ادينسون كافاني في ربع الساعة الأخير، بعد افتتاح السويدي العملاق زلاتان إبراهيموفيتش التسجيل في نهاية الشوط الأول ثم معادلة النيجيري جون اوبي ميكيل. من جهته، يأمل تشيلسي حامل لقب 2012 أن يلعب هدف ميكيل دوراً كبيراً في حسم التأهل، خصوصا وأن الأهداف المسجلة خارج القواعد لعبت دوراً في حسم هوية المتأهل في آخر موسمين.في ربع نهائي 2014، فاز سان جرمان ذهابا 3-1 على أرضه ورد تشيلسي إيابا 2- صفر بهدف متأخر من السنغالي ديمبا با، وفي دور ال16 من النسخة الماضية تأهل سان جرمان بعد تعادله 1-1 على أرضه و2-2 خارج ملعبه في الوقت الإضافي بهدف متأخر من المدافع البرازيلي تياغو سيلفا برغم طرد إبراهيموفيتش في الشوط الأول.وينظر تشيلسي إلى المسابقة القارية لإنقاذ موسمه المتعثر محلياً، فحقق بداية كارثية أطاحت مدربه البرتغالي جوزيه مورينيو قبل أن يصحح مساره بعد تعيين الهولندي المخضرم غوس هيدينك موقتاً حتى نهاية الموسم. ومنذ إقالة مورينيو في ديسمبر/ كانون الأول الماضي، لم يخسر «البلوز» سوى مرة واحدة في 16 مباراة، كانت ضد سان جرمان بالذات ذهاباً.من جهته، يحلق سان جرمان، الذي حل ثانيا في دور المجموعات وراء ريال مدريد الإسباني، بصدارة الدوري الفرنسي بفارق 23 نقطة عن أقرب مطارديه موناكو، وذلك برغم فوزه مرة واحدة فقط في آخر أربع مباريات وتعرضه لأول خسارة في الدوري هذا الموسم أمام ليون الثالث. وبرغم إمكانية احتفال سان جرمان بلقب الدوري مرة رابعة على التوالي الأسبوع المقبل، يعيش المدرب لوران بلان تحت هاجس تحقيق نتيجة طيبة في المسابقة القارية بعد انتعاش خزنة النادي وضمه أفضل لاعبي العالم.ونجح بلان الذي مدد عقده حتى 2018 مع الفريق الباريسي بقيادة سان جرمان إلى رباعية محلية الموسم الماضي، لكن مشواره القاري لم يصل حتى إلى المباراة النهائية في الأعوام الماضية، علما بانه يسعى راهنا للتأهل إلى ربع النهائي لرابع مرة على التوالي.ويحوم الشك حول مشاركة ثنائي وسط سان جرمان بليز ماتويدي والإيطالي ماركو فيراتي.ويعول سان جرمان على هدافه زلاتان المتعطش للقب قاري، والجناح الأرجنتيني انخل دي ماريا الراغب بتبرير صفقة ضمه الهائلة مقابل 63 مليون يورو.أما تشيلسي، فقد يفتقد قلب دفاعه المخضرم جون تيري، فيما أكد هيدينك أن مهاجمه الإسباني دييغو كوستا (14 هدفاً هذا الموسم) سيكون لائقاً بدنياً برغم غيابه عن التعادل الأخير مع ستوك في الدوري.واستعاد تشيلسي البعض من هيبته مؤخرا، فعاد الحارس البلجيكي الشاب تيبو كورتوا إلى مستوياته، ويبرز في صفوفه شعلة النشاط البرازيلي ويليان، فيما لا يزال يبحث عن موهبة البلجيكي ادين هازار الضائعة في موسم تشلسي المخيب محلياً. وفي مباراة مبكرة في روسيا، يستقبل زينيت سان بطرسبرغ بنفيكا البرتغالي بعد فوز الأخير ذهابا بهدف يتيم.وحقق بنفيكا حامل اللقب عامي 1961 و1962 فوزا قاتلا بهدف البرازيلي جوناس غونالفيش أوليفيرا في الدقيقة الأولى من الوقت بدل الضائع.وصمد الفريق الروسي طوال المباراة أمام المد الهجومي لأصحاب الأرض لكنه دفع ثمن فقدان التركيز في الدقائق الحاسمة خصوصا بعد طرد مدافع الدولي الإيطالي دومينيكو كريشيتو في الدقيقة الأخيرة.وقال مدرب زينيت البرتغالي اندريه فياش بواش إن بلوغ ربع النهائي هو «حلمنا» وسيكون «حدثا كبيرا لكرة القدم الروسية».وحسم بنفيكا حامل اللقب البرتغالي في العامين الأخيرين الديربي التقليدي أمام جاره سبورتينغ لشبونة 1- صفر وانتزع منه الصدارة، لكنه يعاني عدة إصابات في خط دفاعه.وفاز فريق المدرب روي فيتوريا 15 مرة في آخر 16 مباراة، وخسر مرة أمام بورتو الفريق السابق لمدربه الحالي فياش بواش.\n",

            "Document 7: يشهد ناديا نيوكاسل وميدلزبرة الإنجليزيان الهابطان مؤخرا الى الدرجة الأولى في الدوري الممتاز اشبه ما يكون بالهجرة الجماعية خصوصا مع تنامي الشعور بالقلق حول ملكية النادي في حالة نيوكاسل وقد ألقى مدافع الفريق سيباستيان باسونغ باللائمة في عرقلة انتقاله الى أرسنال على جهل النادي بمستقبله. اعترف الفرنسي باسونغ (22 عاما) برغبته في ترك الفريق الهابط وامتعاضه من تلقيه أمراً باستئناف التمرينات في تينيسايد معقل الفريق وقال: فرق الدوري الممتاز مهتمة بخدماتي لكن الأمر ليس بسيطا فنيوكاسل في وسط تكهنات ببيعه ولا أحد يعرف من سيكون مدرب الفريق. أستطيع تأكيد وجود عرض من أرسنال لكن لا يوجد اتفاق رسمي. الأندية الأجنبية تجمع معلومات عني لكن الأولوية عندي هي البقاء في انجلترا. يذكر أن المدافع الذي انتقل الى نيوكاسل من ميتز الفرنسي مقابل 500 ألف جنيه قبل 12 شهرا قدم أداء مميزا ويلعب في منتخب فرنسا دون ال21 وقد ارتبط اسمه بمانشستر سيتي وتوتنهام. أما زميله الجناح الأرجنتيني جوناس جيتاريز الملقب بالرجل العنكبوت فيقترب من الانتقال الى نادي روما الإيطالي وذلك لخشيته من البقاء في ناد هبط من دوري النخبة وبالتالي لا يستطيع حجز مقعده في منتخب مارادونا. نيوكاسل يريد استعادة أكبر قدر ممكن من مبلغ شرائه من ريال مايوركا (مقابل 2.5 مليون جنيه). وقد غاب جيتاريز (27 عاما) عن تمرينات نيوكاسل بسبب تمديده لإجازته بعد مشاركته الدولية لكن في الواقع هو يبحث عن حل لصفقة انتقاله قبل عودته الإسبوع المقبل الى الفريق. شارك جيتاريز في 23 مباراة مع نيوكاسل لكنه فشل في التسجيل. ميدلزبرة على الجانب الآخر يشهد أيضا نزيف لاعبيه خصوصا مع اهتمام الأندية الأخرى بهم وآخرهم آدم جونسون الذين ورد فجأة على لائحة اللاعبين الذين يرغب تشلسي في التعاقد معهم ضمن مخطط النادي لضم أكبر عدد ممكن من اللاعبين الإنجليز. ويفكر تشلسي في عرض 8 ملايين جنيه للفوز بجونسون الذي يلعب في منتخب انجلترا دون ال21 عاما وجونسون ليس الوحيد الذي يخطط للرحيل عن الفريق فهناك أيضا تونكاي صوب ايفرتون وستيوارت داوننغ صوب استون فيلا أو توتنهام وأفونسو ألفيس الذي يتطلع للعودة الى بنفيكا البرتغالي المستعد لدفع 4 ملايين جنيه مقابل استعادته بعد أن كان باعه الى ميدلزبرة مقابل 7.12 مليون جنيه في يناير/كانون الثاني 2008 ولم يسجل سوى 4 أهداف في الموسم الماضي.\n",
            "Document 8: قطع يحيى توريه شوطاً كبيراً في مسيرته الاحترافية منذ وصفه مدرب أرسنال الإنجليزي آرسين فينغر باللاعب المتوسط قبل ثمانية أعوام ليصبح اليوم أفضل لاعب في القارة السمراء والقلب النابض لفريقه مانشستر سيتي الإنجليزي ومنتخب بلاده ساحل العاج .يحيى توريه لعب معنا مباراة إعدادية قبل موسم 2003 كمهاجم ثان وكان مستواه متوسطاً هذا ما قاله فينغر لصحيفة دايلي تيلغراف اللندنية هذا الأسبوع . بيد أن اللاعب المتوسط أصبح نجماً ساطعاً في سماء مانشستر سيتي ويساهم بشكل كبير في ريادته للدوري الإنجليزي وتعزيز حظوظه في التتويج باللقب .اللاعب الذي كان عادياً في مباراته مع أرسنال قبل 8 أعوام، كان صانعا للفوز الكبير الذي حققه فريقه الاربعاء الماضي على ستوك سيتي 3-صفر ليحتفظ بصدارة البريمر ليغ بفارق نقطتين أمام غريمه وجاره اللدود مانشستر يونايتد حامل اللقب .يذكر ان يحيى توريه خاض تجربة مع أرسنال عام 2003 عندما كان عمره 20 عاماً فقط وعندما كان شقيقه الاكبر حبيب كولو توريه في صفوف الفريق، بيد أن فينغر لم يعرف أين يوظفه فأشركه كمهاجم ثان في التشكيلة من دون أن ينبهر بمؤهلاته، كما ان مشكلة أخرى واجهت الفريق اللندني هي انه كان يتعين عليه الانتظار مدة طويلة حتى يحصل توريه، الذي كان يلعب وقتها مع بيفرين البلجيكي، على جواز سفر أوروبي أو تصريح عمل في إنجلترا، فانتقل بعدها إلى ميتالورغ دانييتسك الاوكراني .وبعد يوم واحد من مساهمته الفعالة في الفوز على ستوك سيتي، توجه توريه صاحب الطول الفارع والنشيط في وسط الملعب فنياً وبدنياً، إلى العاصمة الغانية اكرا ليتوج أفضل لاعب في القارة السمراء هذا العام .تصريح توريه بعد الجائزة القارية كان مقتضباً ومعبراً، حيث توجه بالشكر إلى شقيقه حبيب مدافع مانشستر سيتي ايضا وعائلته وفريقه الإنجليزي وزملائه في المنتخب العاجي على الدور الذي لعبوه من أجل إحرازه جائزة افضل لاعب في افريقيا .وتقدم توريه على الغاني اندريه ايوو لاعب وسط مرسيليا الفرنسي والمالي سيدو كيتا زميله السابق في صفوف برشلونة الإسباني .وكان أيوو، نجل النجم الغاني السابق عبيدي بيليه المتوج بجائزة افضل لاعب في القارة 3 مرات، صاحب الشعبية الكبرى في الحفل كونه نظم في بلده، ولكن لا أحد يشك في أن توريه كان خير خلف للمهاجم الكاميروني صامويل ايتو .وفضلا عن موسمه الرائع مع فريقه مانشستر سيتي حيث قاده إلى لقب مسابقة كأس إنجلترا ويقوده حاليا إلى صدارة الدوري ويلعب دوراً رئيسياً مع الإسباني دافيد سيلفا وغاريث باري في وسط سيتيزينز، تألق توريه بشكل لافت مع منتخب بلاده، حيث كان منتخب الفيلة الوحيد الذي يحقق العلامة الكاملة في تصفيات كأس امم افريقيا ،2012 اذ هزم منتخبات رواندا وبوروندي وبنين ذهابا وايابا .ويعتبر المنتخب العاجي المرشح الأكبر للظفر بلقب الكأس القارية المقررة في الغابون وغينيا الاستوائية من 21 يناير/كانون الثاني إلى 12 فبراير/شباط المقبلين في ظل غياب المنتخبات القوية في مقدمتها مصر حاملة الرقم القياسي في عدد الالقاب (7 مرات) والمتوجة بلقب النسخ الثلاث الأخيرة، والكاميرون ونيجيريا وجنوب افريقيا والجزائر .وأوقعت القرعة ساحل العاج في المجموعة الثانية إلى جانب منتخبات انغولا وبوركينا فاسو والسودان .وتبدو الفرصة مؤاتية أمام ساحل العاج لتعويض خيبة أملها في النسخ الثلاث الاخيرة عندما كانت مرشحة للقب الثاني في تاريخها حيث خسرت نهائي 2006 أمام مصر المضيفة بركلات الترجيح وخرجت من نصف نهائي 2008 بخسارة مذلة أمام الفراعنة 1-،4 ومن ربع النهائي بخسارة أمام الجزائر 2-3 بعد التمديد .وشدد توريه على أهمية كرة القدم في بلاده التي دخلت في حرب أهلية العام الماضي بعد رفض الرئيس السابق لوران غباغبو خسارته في الانتخابات أمام الحسن واتارا .ويقول توريه بلادنا تحتاج إلى أشخاص مثلي ومثل (مهاجم تشلسي الإنجليزي) ديدييه دروغبا في الوقت الحالي، ومن المهم ان نقوم بكل ما في وسعنا من أجل شعبنا .واعترف توريه بشعوره بالحيرة والذنب لتركه فريقه مانشستر سيتي للدفاع عن ألوان منتخب بلاده في الكأس القارية في وقت يحارب فيه السيتيزنز على أربع واجهات هي الدوري والكأس وكأس الرابطة المحلية والدوري الأوروبي، بيد أنه أكد ان مانشستر سيتي قادر على تعويض غيابه .وأضاف في تصريحات لوسائل الاعلام الإنجليزية لدينا لاعبون رائعون بامكانهم سد الفراغ . لن أغيب فترة طويلة وأرغب في العودة ومساعدة فريقي للفوز بلقب الدوري .جماهير المنتخب العاجي تأمل في ان يعود توريه إلى صفوف فريقه في 13 فبراير المقبل اي بعد يوم واحد من المباراة النهائية المقررة في ليبروفيل والتي يرشح العديد من المراقبين ساحل العاج وغانا ليكونا طرفيها .بدأ توريه مسيرته الاحترافية منذ عشرة أعوام مع بيفيرين البلجيكي ثم حمل ألوان أندية مختلفة في دول عدة، فانتقل إلى ميتالورغ دونتيسك الاوكراني واولمبياكوس اليوناني وموناكو الفرنسي وبرشلونة قبل توجهه إلى مانشستر سيتي .وتوريه هو ثاني لاعب عاجي يحرز الجائزة بعد دروغبا .\n",
            "Document 9: اقترب فريق توتنهام من ضم لاعب الوسط الفرنسي الدولي مورجان شنايدرلين والمهاجم الإنجليزي جاي رودريغيز من صفوف ساوثمبتون . ووصلت مفاوضات توتنهام مع شنايدرلين ورودريغيز وكلاهما في الرابعة والعشرين من العمر إلى مرحلة متقدمة جداً . وتخلى ساوثمبتون عن كوكبة من نجومه في فترة الانتقالات الصيفية الحالية، على رأسهم ريكي لامبرت ولوك شو وادام لالانا وديان لوفرين وكالوم تشامبرز .وذكرت تقارير صحفية أن قيمة صفقة شنايدرلين قد تصل إلى 27 مليون جنيه استرليني . ويتعافى رودريغيز، الذي انضم لساوثمبتون في 2012 مقابل سبعة ملايين استرليني، حالياً من قطع في الرباط الصليبي للركبة .\n",
            "Document 10: عندما ينظر مشجعو تشلسي إلى تعاقدات الساعات الأخيرة من موسم التنقلات الشتوية لمعرفة من يصنع الفارق في تسجيل الأهداف، لا يرون بصمة المهاجم الأسباني فيرناندو توريس بل المدافع البرازيلي ديفيد لويز (23 عاماً) الذي حطم العريق مانشستر يونايتد ومدربه بهدف الفوز على ملعب ستامفورد بريدج . الواقع كان يقول إن على لويز مصارعة روني ومنعه من شق خط الدفاع لكن كرة طائرة من لويز أثبتت تعدد مهارات هذا اللاعب وأحقية دفع تشلسي 25 مليون جنيه لشرائه من بنفيكا .قال لويز مرة في لقاء صحافي عندما كان لاعباً في صفوف النادي البرتغالي: كل يوم أنت بحاجة لتكون أكثر ذكاء، كرة القدم كانت بطيئة الإيقاع وتعتمد على القوة البدنية كثيراً، لكن على لاعبي اليوم أن يكونوا أكثر دراية بالتكتيك والتفكير بسرعة في ردة الفعل المناسبة .وصل لويز الى البرتغال بشعر قصير لكنه أطلق شعره مثل مدافع برشلونة كارلوس بويول وكيفن كيغان في ،1980 وأصبحت تسريحته الخيار الأول للشباب في مدينة لشبونة . يقول راميريز الذي انتقل من بنفيكا الى تشلسي في أغسطس/آب الماضي عن لويز: الجميع في بنفيكا كان يحبه ليس لمهاراته في الملعب فقط بل لأنه يحب مساعدة الآخرين وكنت أنا من بين المستفيدين من كرمه . لويز يملك كل مقومات النجاح في تشلسي وقلبه كبير ولطيف المعشر .لكن لويز قبل أقل من عشر سنوات قال له نادي فيتوريا باهيا المنافس في الدرجة الثانية إنه لا يصلح للعب في صفوفه لأنه لن يكون طويل القامة أبدا وليس قوياً ليكون لاعباً محترفاً فتدخل المدرب بيكسوتو الشهير ب تيو وأقنع النادي بضرورة قبول الفتى ذي الأربعة عشر ربيعاً وتطوير مهاراته من لاعب وسط الى مدافع . ويقول تيو: ديفيد كان دوماً ممتناً لي فقد كاد يطرد من فيتوريا لولا تدخلي، كان نحيلاً ويلعب في المكان الخطأ . حاولت الإيمان بمواهبه وكادت الإدارة تطرده مرتين وفي المرة الثانية اتصل بي باكيا فطلبت من مدرب فريق الناشئين الإبقاء عليه . نصحته بتطوير مهاراته الدفاعية وعلمته كيفية تسلم الكرة والتموضع ومحاولة التوازن وعدم فقدان السيطرة على مشاعره مطلقاً، وبفضل ذكائه وموهبته تأقلم حتى صار متواجدا على الدوام في التشكيلة وأنا فخور جدا به الآن .لويز من جانبه يتذكر أيضا تلك البدايات فيقول: عندما كنت في الرابعة عشرةتوجب علي الاختيار وتوجب علي العيش بعيدا عن أسرتي مسافة 40 ساعة بالسيارة ووقعت أول عقد احتراف لي مع فيتوريا، وعرفت حينها أن بإستطاعتي تغيير واقع حياة أسرتي ومنح والدي ووالدتي الحياة التي يستحقونها، كان ذلك حلمي وكان دوما حاضرا في بالي . أعرف جيدا أن الحياة يمكن أن تكون صعبة أحيانا وأن علي التركيز في اختيار الطريق الصحيح . في فيتوريا واجهت صعوبة في التأقلم في البداية ومرت علي أوقات لم أر نفسي لاعبا محترفا في المستقبل . بعد سماح فيتوريا له بالبقاء بدأ لويز في برنامج تنمية عضلاته لستة أشهر لكنه لم يعد يفكر في تغيير رياضته من الكرة الى رياضته المفضلة الجودو، غيرأن أحلامه مع ذلك لم تذهب به بعيدا حتى اللعب في أفضل الأندية البرازيلية ناهيك عن الأوروبية . غيليانو بيرتولوتشي وكيل أعماله أقنع بنفيكا باستعارته مقابل حصول فيتوريا على نصف أجره . كانت أول مباراة له أمام باريس سان جيرمان وكانت مخيبة للآمال فقد أضاع لويز فرصة تسجيل هدف وأمضى الليلة مريضا في المستشفى، لكن سرعان ما محيت تلك الذكرى الأليمة وتكلل مشوار لويز بالنجاح ولم ينغص موسم 2007-2008 سوى حاجته لعمليتين جراحيتين وزرع برغي معدني في الإصبع الصغير في قدمه اليمنى . قال عنه أحد الصحافيين البرتغاليين: يحب لويز مناورة الدفاع وشق صفوفهم، في أحيان كثيرة ينجح في اجتياز كثير من المدافعين، وفجأة يفقد الكرة لكنه مع ذلك شديد الثقة بنفسه ويرى أنه مارادونا . فينغر يتوقع مشاركة فابريغاس في مباراة برشلونةكشف ارسين فينغر المدير الفني لفريق ارسنال الإنجليزي النقاب عن أن قائد فريقه سيسك فابريغاس، لن يكون جاهزاً للمشاركة في المباراة المقبلة أمام سندرلاند، ولكنه سيتمكن من المشاركة في المباراة أمام برشلونة يوم الثلاثاء المقبل في دوري أبطال أوروبا . ويعاني فابريغاس من إصابة في أوتار الساق تعرض لها خلال المباراة أمام ستوك سيتي الاسبوع الماضي . وأوضح أتمنى أن يلحق فابريغاس بمباراة يوم الثلاثاء، لديه فرصة المشاركة أمام برشلونة ولكني لا أتوقع مشاركته في مباراة سندرلاند .من ناحية أخرى أشار فينغر إلى أن الإصابة التي تعرض لها الهولندي روبن فان بيرسي خلال المباراة أمام برمنغهام في نهائي كأس كارلينغ قد تبعده عن الملاعب نحو شهر .\n"

            "Document 1: اعتادت جماهير تشلسي متابعة لاعبيها الجدد في بداية كل موسم، لكن هذا العام يوجد اسم واحد مألوف يتوقع أن يخطف الأضواء في النادي المنتمي للدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز لكرة القدم .وكان سيسك فابريغاس من نجوم الدوري الإنجليزي خلال ثماني سنوات قضاها في صفوف لندن غريم تشلسي قبل أن يعود في 2011 إلى ناديه الإسباني برشلونة الذي شهد بداية مشواره .وربما تمثل عودة فابريغاس إلى لندن واحدة من أهم صفقات كرة القدم الإنجليزية خلال الصيف الجاري .ويتطلع جوزيه مورينيو مدرب تشلسي للاستفادة من إمكانات فابريغاس في وسط الملعب لمساعدة الفريق الذي عانى كثيراً على تسجيل الأهداف خلال موسم 2013-2014 .وفاز تشلسي بكل مبارياته على منافسيه في المربع الذهبي للدوري الموسم الماضي باستثناء مواجهة واحدة لكنه أهدر النقاط أمام فرق أقل قوة كانت تلجأ إلى الدفاع، وهو ما كلفه خسارة اللقب .وينتظر مورينيو أن ينجح فابريغاس في سد فراغ المخضرم فرانك لامبارد الذي ساعدته نزعته الهجومية على أن يصبح الهداف التاريخي للنادي رغم أنه من لاعبي خط الوسط، وترك لامبارد تشلسي في نهاية الموسم الماضي بعدما قضى 13 موسماً في النادي .وقال مورينيو عن فابريغاس: \"أرى أن بوسعه اللعب في كل مكان لأنه يستطيع أن يفعل ذلك، أهم ما يميزه السرعة في قدرته على تحليل المباراة والتعامل معها، إنه لاعب ذكي جداً، نحن في حاجة إلى مخه الكروي في فريقنا\" .ومن المنتظر أن يكون فابريغاس من العوامل المساعدة لظهور لاعب آخر جديد هو المهاجم دييغو كوستا القادم من أتلتيكو مدريد في ظل عدم ثبات مستوى زميله في المنتخب الإسباني فرناندو توريس .وأحرز كوستا 64 هدفاً في 134 مباراة مع أتلتيكو، وهو ما يتناقض تماماً مع المستوى الهزيل لتوريس الذي أحرز 11 هدفاً الموسم الماضي .وفي ظل تعرض مورينيو لضغوط بعدما خرج من الموسم الماضي من دون أي لقب، فإن الأولوية بالنسبة إلى المدرب البرتغالي ستكون في إيجاد الأسلوب المناسب لتسجيل المزيد من الأهداف .لكن مورينيو حاول أيضاً تدعيم خط دفاع فريقه الذي استقبل الموسم الماضي 27 هدفاً في 38 مباراة، وهو ما يقل بعشرة أهداف عما استقبله مانشستر سيتي بطل الدوري .وضم تشلسي الظهير الأيسر فيليبي لويس، واستعاد جهود الحارس تيبو كورتوا من أتليتيكو مدريد بعد انتهاء إعارته في آخر ثلاثة مواسم .\n",
            "Document 2: عندما ينظر مشجعو تشلسي إلى تعاقدات الساعات الأخيرة من موسم التنقلات الشتوية لمعرفة من يصنع الفارق في تسجيل الأهداف، لا يرون بصمة المهاجم الأسباني فيرناندو توريس بل المدافع البرازيلي ديفيد لويز (23 عاماً) الذي حطم العريق مانشستر يونايتد ومدربه بهدف الفوز على ملعب ستامفورد بريدج . الواقع كان يقول إن على لويز مصارعة روني ومنعه من شق خط الدفاع لكن كرة طائرة من لويز أثبتت تعدد مهارات هذا اللاعب وأحقية دفع تشلسي 25 مليون جنيه لشرائه من بنفيكا .قال لويز مرة في لقاء صحافي عندما كان لاعباً في صفوف النادي البرتغالي: كل يوم أنت بحاجة لتكون أكثر ذكاء، كرة القدم كانت بطيئة الإيقاع وتعتمد على القوة البدنية كثيراً، لكن على لاعبي اليوم أن يكونوا أكثر دراية بالتكتيك والتفكير بسرعة في ردة الفعل المناسبة .وصل لويز الى البرتغال بشعر قصير لكنه أطلق شعره مثل مدافع برشلونة كارلوس بويول وكيفن كيغان في ،1980 وأصبحت تسريحته الخيار الأول للشباب في مدينة لشبونة . يقول راميريز الذي انتقل من بنفيكا الى تشلسي في أغسطس/آب الماضي عن لويز: الجميع في بنفيكا كان يحبه ليس لمهاراته في الملعب فقط بل لأنه يحب مساعدة الآخرين وكنت أنا من بين المستفيدين من كرمه . لويز يملك كل مقومات النجاح في تشلسي وقلبه كبير ولطيف المعشر .لكن لويز قبل أقل من عشر سنوات قال له نادي فيتوريا باهيا المنافس في الدرجة الثانية إنه لا يصلح للعب في صفوفه لأنه لن يكون طويل القامة أبدا وليس قوياً ليكون لاعباً محترفاً فتدخل المدرب بيكسوتو الشهير ب تيو وأقنع النادي بضرورة قبول الفتى ذي الأربعة عشر ربيعاً وتطوير مهاراته من لاعب وسط الى مدافع . ويقول تيو: ديفيد كان دوماً ممتناً لي فقد كاد يطرد من فيتوريا لولا تدخلي، كان نحيلاً ويلعب في المكان الخطأ . حاولت الإيمان بمواهبه وكادت الإدارة تطرده مرتين وفي المرة الثانية اتصل بي باكيا فطلبت من مدرب فريق الناشئين الإبقاء عليه . نصحته بتطوير مهاراته الدفاعية وعلمته كيفية تسلم الكرة والتموضع ومحاولة التوازن وعدم فقدان السيطرة على مشاعره مطلقاً، وبفضل ذكائه وموهبته تأقلم حتى صار متواجدا على الدوام في التشكيلة وأنا فخور جدا به الآن .لويز من جانبه يتذكر أيضا تلك البدايات فيقول: عندما كنت في الرابعة عشرةتوجب علي الاختيار وتوجب علي العيش بعيدا عن أسرتي مسافة 40 ساعة بالسيارة ووقعت أول عقد احتراف لي مع فيتوريا، وعرفت حينها أن بإستطاعتي تغيير واقع حياة أسرتي ومنح والدي ووالدتي الحياة التي يستحقونها، كان ذلك حلمي وكان دوما حاضرا في بالي . أعرف جيدا أن الحياة يمكن أن تكون صعبة أحيانا وأن علي التركيز في اختيار الطريق الصحيح . في فيتوريا واجهت صعوبة في التأقلم في البداية ومرت علي أوقات لم أر نفسي لاعبا محترفا في المستقبل . بعد سماح فيتوريا له بالبقاء بدأ لويز في برنامج تنمية عضلاته لستة أشهر لكنه لم يعد يفكر في تغيير رياضته من الكرة الى رياضته المفضلة الجودو، غيرأن أحلامه مع ذلك لم تذهب به بعيدا حتى اللعب في أفضل الأندية البرازيلية ناهيك عن الأوروبية . غيليانو بيرتولوتشي وكيل أعماله أقنع بنفيكا باستعارته مقابل حصول فيتوريا على نصف أجره . كانت أول مباراة له أمام باريس سان جيرمان وكانت مخيبة للآمال فقد أضاع لويز فرصة تسجيل هدف وأمضى الليلة مريضا في المستشفى، لكن سرعان ما محيت تلك الذكرى الأليمة وتكلل مشوار لويز بالنجاح ولم ينغص موسم 2007-2008 سوى حاجته لعمليتين جراحيتين وزرع برغي معدني في الإصبع الصغير في قدمه اليمنى . قال عنه أحد الصحافيين البرتغاليين: يحب لويز مناورة الدفاع وشق صفوفهم، في أحيان كثيرة ينجح في اجتياز كثير من المدافعين، وفجأة يفقد الكرة لكنه مع ذلك شديد الثقة بنفسه ويرى أنه مارادونا . فينغر يتوقع مشاركة فابريغاس في مباراة برشلونةكشف ارسين فينغر المدير الفني لفريق ارسنال الإنجليزي النقاب عن أن قائد فريقه سيسك فابريغاس، لن يكون جاهزاً للمشاركة في المباراة المقبلة أمام سندرلاند، ولكنه سيتمكن من المشاركة في المباراة أمام برشلونة يوم الثلاثاء المقبل في دوري أبطال أوروبا . ويعاني فابريغاس من إصابة في أوتار الساق تعرض لها خلال المباراة أمام ستوك سيتي الاسبوع الماضي . وأوضح أتمنى أن يلحق فابريغاس بمباراة يوم الثلاثاء، لديه فرصة المشاركة أمام برشلونة ولكني لا أتوقع مشاركته في مباراة سندرلاند .من ناحية أخرى أشار فينغر إلى أن الإصابة التي تعرض لها الهولندي روبن فان بيرسي خلال المباراة أمام برمنغهام في نهائي كأس كارلينغ قد تبعده عن الملاعب نحو شهر .\n",
            "Document 3: ابتعد تشلسي في الصدارة بعد فوزه على مضيفه وجاره فولهام متذيل الترتيب 3-،1 مستفيدا من الخدمة التي قدمها له ستوك سيتي بفوزه على أرسنال 1-صفر أمس في المرحلة الثامنة والعشرين من الدوري الإنجليزي لكرة القدم .ومرة أخرى كان للاعبي الوسط دور المنقذ بالنسبة لتشلسي إذ تعملق الألماني اندري شورله بتسجيله الأهداف الثلاثة لفريق المدرب البرتغالي جوزيه مورينيو الذي يعاني حتى الآن ضعف شهية مهاجميه الثلاثة الإسباني فرناندو توريس والكاميروني صامويل إيتو والسنغالي دمبا با الذين سجلوا مجتمعين ما مجموعه 11 هدفاً فقط .بدأ مورينيو اللقاء بإشراك توريس وحيدا في خط المقدمة بعد الهدف الثمين الذي سجله الإسباني في منتصف الأسبوع على ارض غلطة سراي التركي (1-1) في ذهاب الدور الثاني من مسابقة دوري أبطال أوروبا، فيما دخل با في الثواني الأخيرة وغاب إيتو عن التشكيلة باكملها .وانتظر تشلسي حتى الشوط الثاني لكي يحسم اللقاء بفضل ثلاثية سريعة لشورله الذي سجل اهدافه الثلاثة في حوالي ربع ساعة، الأول في الدقيقة 52 بعد تمريرة بينية من البلجيكي المتألق ادين هازار الذي كان مهندس الهدف الثاني لزميله الألماني في الدقيقة ،65 فيما ساهم توريس بالهدف الثالث الذي جاء في الدقيقة 69 قبل ان يقلص الهولندي جوني هيتينغا الفارق لأصحاب الأرض في الدقيقة 74 اثر ركلة ركنية من دارن بنت .وفي ظل غياب مانشستر سيتي عن هذه المرحلة بسبب انشغاله اليوم بنهائي كأس الرابطة ضد سندرلاند، استغل تشلسي الفرصة لكي يبتعد عنه بفارق 6 نقاط مستغلا تفوقه على جاره الجريح فولهام الذي سقط على ارضه أمام ال\"بلوز\" للمرة الثامنة على التوالي .كما استفاد تشلسي من الخدمة التي قدمها له ستوك سيتي على ملعب \"بريتانيا ستاديوم\" بإسقاطه أرسنال لكي يبتعد عن \"المدفعجية\" بفارق أربع نقاط، علما أن الفريقين اللندنيين خاضا مباراتين اكثر من منافسهما مانشستر سيتي .وتواصلت عقدة أرسنال على ملعب \"بريتانيا ستاديوم\" حيث لم يذق طعم الانتصار في زياراته السادسة على التوالي وقد مني بهزيمته الخامسة هذا الموسم بسبب الهدية التي قدمها مدافعه الفرنسي لوران كوسييلني لأصحاب الأرض بعد أن منحهم ركلة جزاء في وقت صعب من المباراة بلمسه الكرة بيده داخل المنطقة، فانبرى لها جوناثان وولترز بنجاح (76) في لقاء شارك فيه الألماني مسعود أوزيل خلال الشوط الثاني (دخل في الدقيقة 66 بدلا من مواطنه لوكاس بودولسكي) .وكان المدرب الفرنسي ارسين فينغر استبعد أوزيل عن مباراة المرحلة السابقة امام سندرلاند (4-1) اثر الانتقادات التي واجهها لاعب فيردر بريمن وريال مدريد الإسباني السابق بسبب اهداره ركلة جزاء ضد بايرن ميونيخ الألماني في ذهاب الدور الثاني من مسابقة دوري ابطال أوروبا في مباراة خسرها فريقه على ارضه صفر-2 في 19 الشهر الحالي .وعلى ملعب \"غوديسون بارك\"، جدد إيفرتون الموعد مع الانتصارات التي غابت عنه في المرحلتين السابقتين (خسر امام توتنهام وتشلسي صفر-1 ولم يحقق سوى فوز واحد في مبارياته الخمس السابقة)، وذلك بتغلبه على ضيفه وست هام يونايتد بصعوبة بهدف سجله البلجيكي روميلو لوكاكو، المعار اليه من تشلسي، في الدقيقة 81 .وتغلب نيوكاسل يونايتد على مضيفه هال سيتي بأربعة اهداف للفرنسيين موسى سيسوكو (10 و55) ولويك ريمي (42) والهولندي فورنون انيتا (3+90)، مقابل هدف لكورتيس ديفيس (46) .\n",
            "Document 4: بعد فوز ويغان أثليتيك 1-صفر على مانشستر سيتي في نهائي كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي لكرة القدم، لم يقتصر الأمر فقط على واحدة من أكبر المفاجآت في المسابقة بل أنه قد يمتد لتحديد مستقبل مدربي الفريقين .ونفى الإيطالي روبرتو مانشيني مدرب سيتي تكهنات غبية بأنه في طريقه للرحيل عن النادي الذي قاده للقب كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي قبل عامين والفوز بالدوري الممتاز الموسم الماضي لكنه واجه صعوبات في التحلي بالهدوء خلال المؤتمر الصحفي عقب اللقاء .وتجنب الإسباني روبرتو مارتينيز مدرب ويغان أسئلة تتعلق باحتمال انتقاله إلى إيفرتون كبديل لديفيد مويز الذي سيرحل عن الفريق ليتولى مسؤولية مانشستر يونايتد بطل الدوري خلفاً لاليكس فيرغسون بداية من الموسم المقبل .وبدا على مانشيني التأثر بتقارير صحفية تكهنت بان التشيلي مانويل بليغريني مدرب ملقة الإسباني في طريقه لتولي مسؤولية سيتي بدلاً منه .وقال مانشيني هذا الأمر موجود منذ ستة أشهر . اعتقد أن هذا غباء وانتم تكتبون هذه الأمور وربما تعلمون لكن أنا موجود في عالم كرة القدم منذ مدة طويلة وسأنتظر لأرى ماذا سيحدث .وأضاف مانشستر يونايتد لم يفز بالدوري الممتاز أو بكأس الاتحاد الانجليزي الموسم الماضي، ولم تكتبوا عن هذا . ربما يحدث شيء لا أعلمه وانا غبي لكن توجد مباراتان أمامنا وسنرى ماذا سيحدث في نهاية الموسم .وتابع كم فريق قدم أفضل منا هذا الموسم؟ فريق واحد . مانشستر يونايتد . نحن في المركز الثاني بالدوري وصعدنا إلى نهائي الكأس . لم نحقق اهدافنا لكن خضنا موسما جيداً .وظهر مارتينيز أكثر سعادة وهو يتحدث عن أحد أنديته السابقة وهو سوانزي سيتي الذي أحرز لقباً كبيراً لأول مرة في تاريخه هذا الموسم بعد فوزه بكأس رابطة الأندية الانجليزية .وسيشارك سوانزي مثل ويغان في كأس الأندية الأوروبية الموسم المقبل، وأكد مارتينيز انه فخور بانجاز الفريق الويلزي .وقال مارتينيز إنه يلعب بطريقة مشابهة لنا، وأنا سعيد للغاية إنه تمتع بهذا النجاح في الموسم الحالي .لكن مارتينيز سيضع تركيزه الآن على إبقاء ويغان في الدوري الممتاز إذ يقبع الفريق في المركز 18 بين 20 نادياً، ويحتاج لثلاث نقاط من مباراتيه أمام أرسنال واستون فيلا للنجاة من مصير لا يرغب فيه .وإذا هبط سيصبح ويغان أول فريق يفوز بكأس الاتحاد الانجليزي ويهبط في الموسم نفسه إلى الدرجة الثانية .على خط آخر، دخل حارس ويغان العماني علي الحبسي التاريخ بعدما أصبح أول عربي يحمل كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي، رغم أنه لم يكن أساسياً في المباراة النهائية .\n",
            "Document 5: قطع يحيى توريه شوطاً كبيراً في مسيرته الاحترافية منذ وصفه مدرب أرسنال الإنجليزي آرسين فينغر باللاعب المتوسط قبل ثمانية أعوام ليصبح اليوم أفضل لاعب في القارة السمراء والقلب النابض لفريقه مانشستر سيتي الإنجليزي ومنتخب بلاده ساحل العاج .يحيى توريه لعب معنا مباراة إعدادية قبل موسم 2003 كمهاجم ثان وكان مستواه متوسطاً هذا ما قاله فينغر لصحيفة دايلي تيلغراف اللندنية هذا الأسبوع . بيد أن اللاعب المتوسط أصبح نجماً ساطعاً في سماء مانشستر سيتي ويساهم بشكل كبير في ريادته للدوري الإنجليزي وتعزيز حظوظه في التتويج باللقب .اللاعب الذي كان عادياً في مباراته مع أرسنال قبل 8 أعوام، كان صانعا للفوز الكبير الذي حققه فريقه الاربعاء الماضي على ستوك سيتي 3-صفر ليحتفظ بصدارة البريمر ليغ بفارق نقطتين أمام غريمه وجاره اللدود مانشستر يونايتد حامل اللقب .يذكر ان يحيى توريه خاض تجربة مع أرسنال عام 2003 عندما كان عمره 20 عاماً فقط وعندما كان شقيقه الاكبر حبيب كولو توريه في صفوف الفريق، بيد أن فينغر لم يعرف أين يوظفه فأشركه كمهاجم ثان في التشكيلة من دون أن ينبهر بمؤهلاته، كما ان مشكلة أخرى واجهت الفريق اللندني هي انه كان يتعين عليه الانتظار مدة طويلة حتى يحصل توريه، الذي كان يلعب وقتها مع بيفرين البلجيكي، على جواز سفر أوروبي أو تصريح عمل في إنجلترا، فانتقل بعدها إلى ميتالورغ دانييتسك الاوكراني .وبعد يوم واحد من مساهمته الفعالة في الفوز على ستوك سيتي، توجه توريه صاحب الطول الفارع والنشيط في وسط الملعب فنياً وبدنياً، إلى العاصمة الغانية اكرا ليتوج أفضل لاعب في القارة السمراء هذا العام .تصريح توريه بعد الجائزة القارية كان مقتضباً ومعبراً، حيث توجه بالشكر إلى شقيقه حبيب مدافع مانشستر سيتي ايضا وعائلته وفريقه الإنجليزي وزملائه في المنتخب العاجي على الدور الذي لعبوه من أجل إحرازه جائزة افضل لاعب في افريقيا .وتقدم توريه على الغاني اندريه ايوو لاعب وسط مرسيليا الفرنسي والمالي سيدو كيتا زميله السابق في صفوف برشلونة الإسباني .وكان أيوو، نجل النجم الغاني السابق عبيدي بيليه المتوج بجائزة افضل لاعب في القارة 3 مرات، صاحب الشعبية الكبرى في الحفل كونه نظم في بلده، ولكن لا أحد يشك في أن توريه كان خير خلف للمهاجم الكاميروني صامويل ايتو .وفضلا عن موسمه الرائع مع فريقه مانشستر سيتي حيث قاده إلى لقب مسابقة كأس إنجلترا ويقوده حاليا إلى صدارة الدوري ويلعب دوراً رئيسياً مع الإسباني دافيد سيلفا وغاريث باري في وسط سيتيزينز، تألق توريه بشكل لافت مع منتخب بلاده، حيث كان منتخب الفيلة الوحيد الذي يحقق العلامة الكاملة في تصفيات كأس امم افريقيا ،2012 اذ هزم منتخبات رواندا وبوروندي وبنين ذهابا وايابا .ويعتبر المنتخب العاجي المرشح الأكبر للظفر بلقب الكأس القارية المقررة في الغابون وغينيا الاستوائية من 21 يناير/كانون الثاني إلى 12 فبراير/شباط المقبلين في ظل غياب المنتخبات القوية في مقدمتها مصر حاملة الرقم القياسي في عدد الالقاب (7 مرات) والمتوجة بلقب النسخ الثلاث الأخيرة، والكاميرون ونيجيريا وجنوب افريقيا والجزائر .وأوقعت القرعة ساحل العاج في المجموعة الثانية إلى جانب منتخبات انغولا وبوركينا فاسو والسودان .وتبدو الفرصة مؤاتية أمام ساحل العاج لتعويض خيبة أملها في النسخ الثلاث الاخيرة عندما كانت مرشحة للقب الثاني في تاريخها حيث خسرت نهائي 2006 أمام مصر المضيفة بركلات الترجيح وخرجت من نصف نهائي 2008 بخسارة مذلة أمام الفراعنة 1-،4 ومن ربع النهائي بخسارة أمام الجزائر 2-3 بعد التمديد .وشدد توريه على أهمية كرة القدم في بلاده التي دخلت في حرب أهلية العام الماضي بعد رفض الرئيس السابق لوران غباغبو خسارته في الانتخابات أمام الحسن واتارا .ويقول توريه بلادنا تحتاج إلى أشخاص مثلي ومثل (مهاجم تشلسي الإنجليزي) ديدييه دروغبا في الوقت الحالي، ومن المهم ان نقوم بكل ما في وسعنا من أجل شعبنا .واعترف توريه بشعوره بالحيرة والذنب لتركه فريقه مانشستر سيتي للدفاع عن ألوان منتخب بلاده في الكأس القارية في وقت يحارب فيه السيتيزنز على أربع واجهات هي الدوري والكأس وكأس الرابطة المحلية والدوري الأوروبي، بيد أنه أكد ان مانشستر سيتي قادر على تعويض غيابه .وأضاف في تصريحات لوسائل الاعلام الإنجليزية لدينا لاعبون رائعون بامكانهم سد الفراغ . لن أغيب فترة طويلة وأرغب في العودة ومساعدة فريقي للفوز بلقب الدوري .جماهير المنتخب العاجي تأمل في ان يعود توريه إلى صفوف فريقه في 13 فبراير المقبل اي بعد يوم واحد من المباراة النهائية المقررة في ليبروفيل والتي يرشح العديد من المراقبين ساحل العاج وغانا ليكونا طرفيها .بدأ توريه مسيرته الاحترافية منذ عشرة أعوام مع بيفيرين البلجيكي ثم حمل ألوان أندية مختلفة في دول عدة، فانتقل إلى ميتالورغ دونتيسك الاوكراني واولمبياكوس اليوناني وموناكو الفرنسي وبرشلونة قبل توجهه إلى مانشستر سيتي .وتوريه هو ثاني لاعب عاجي يحرز الجائزة بعد دروغبا .\n"
